/*
Write a function `bestSum(targetSum, arr)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum.

If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.
