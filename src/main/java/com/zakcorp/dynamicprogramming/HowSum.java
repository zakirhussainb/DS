Write a function `howSum(targetSum, arr)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return an array containing any combination of elements that add u[ to exactly the targetSum. If there
is no combination that add up to the targetSum, then return null.

If there are  multiple combinations possible, you may return any single one.
