Dynamic programming

1. Count the total no. of ways.
2. There are multiple no. of ways and you have to give me the minimum

Try all possible ways -> recursion
-> Count
-> Best way (Either minimum or maximum)

Shortcut tip:-

Step 1 : Try to represent the problem in terms of index.

Step 2 : Do all possible stuffs on that index, according to the problem statement.

Step 3 :

i. Count all the ways -> then you have to sum up of all the stuffs.

ii. Min of all the ways -> then find the minimum of all the stuffs. 

iii. Max of all the ways -> then find the maximum of all the stuffs.
