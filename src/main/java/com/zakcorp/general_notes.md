           Bit Manipulation
1. Multiplication by 2 => Eg. N * 2 => N << 1
2. Division by 2 => Eg. N / 2 => N >> 1 or N >>> 1
3. Modulo by 2 => Eg. N % 2 => N & 1

           CodeForces Problems Difficulty Ratings

I have just reviewed the present histogram of the difficulty ratings using the filtering feature. The present 4721 problems in the problem set can be clustered into the following 12 groups with respect to their associated difficulty ratings.

| Group | Difficulty Range |
|-------|------------------|
| A     | 500-1000         |
| B     | 1100-1200        |
| C     | 1300-1400        |
| D     | 1500-1600        |
| E     | 1700-1800        |
| F     | 1900-2000        |
| G     | 2100-2200        |
| H     | 2300-2400        |
| I     | 2500-2600        |
| J     | 2700-2800        |
| K     | 2900-3000        |
| L     | 3100-3500        |

It should make sense that problems of future contests belong to the aforementioned groups as follows.

| Contest     | Difficulty Range |
|-------------|------------------|
| Div 3       | 500-2000         |
| Div 2       | 1500-2600        |
| Div 1       | 2100-3500        |
| Educational | 1300-2800        |
