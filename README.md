# Problem 3096: Minimum Levels to Gain More Points

## Question

Alice and Bob are playing a game with `n` levels represented by a binary array `possible`. Each level can be either cleared (1) or not cleared (0). Clearing a level gives +1 point, while failing gives -1 point. Alice plays first from level 0 to some level `k`, then Bob plays the remaining levels. Both players play optimally to maximize their own points. Find the minimum number of levels Alice should play to have more points than Bob. If not possible, return `-1`.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`

Each player must play at least 1 level.

## Approach

### 1. **Transform the Array**:

- Convert each `0` in `possible` to `-1` (since failing gives -1 point) and keep `1` as is (clearing gives +1 point).

### 2. **Calculate Total Points**:

- Compute the total points (`ts`) if all levels are played.

### 3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:

- Iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (`alexMaxPoint`) of Alice's points. At each step:
  - Calculate Bob's points as `ts - alexMaxPoint`.
  - Check if Alice's points exceed Bob's points.
  - Ensure Bob has at least one level to play (i.e., Alice doesn't play all levels).

### 4. **Early Termination**:

- Return the first valid level count where Alice's points > Bob's points. If no such scenario exists, return `-1`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm involves two passes through the array: one for transformation and total sum calculation, and another for prefix sum and comparison.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a few variables are used, and the input array is modified in-place.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLevels(int[] possible) {
        int ts = 0;
        int n = possible.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (possible[i] == 0) {
                ts += -1;
                possible[i] = -1;
            } else {
                ts += 1;
            }
        }

        int alexMaxPoint = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            alexMaxPoint += possible[i];
            int bobMaxPoint = ts - alexMaxPoint;
            if (alexMaxPoint > bobMaxPoint) {
                if (n - (i + 1) > 0) { // Ensure Bob has at least one level
                    return i + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

Additional Insights
Optimal Play:
Both players aim to maximize their own points, but Alice's advantage comes from choosing where to stop to leave Bob with fewer opportunities.
Edge Cases:
If all levels are 0, both players end with -1 points, so return -1.
If Alice takes all but one level, Bob's single level must yield fewer points, which is only possible if Alice's cumulative points are sufficiently high.
Efficiency:
The O(n) approach is optimal given the constraints, as it avoids nested loops or complex data structures.
